#Forking a repository (open source project)
    by forking someone's repository into your github account,
    you can work on that community project and then make a 
    pull request (when you have added a new feature successfully), 
    without hindering with the already working project. 

    url for repo on your github account is called "orgin url"
    url for repo on account from where you have forked is called "upstream url"
